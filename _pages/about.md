Hello! I am a Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. Student at Purdue University studying advanced thermal systems for building applications at [Herrick Labs](). The main purpose of this website is to host my academic portfolio, but that doesn't mean there won't be fun stuff on here too, so feel free to check it out!

Best way to contact me is through [email](afarha@purdue.edu)
