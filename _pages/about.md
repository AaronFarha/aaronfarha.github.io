Hello! I am a Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. Student at Purdue University studying advanced thermal systems for building applications at [Herrick Labs](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Herrick). My research interests include heat pumps, DC Micro and Nanogrids, and thermal storage. I am co-advised by [Dr. Eckhard Groll](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/People/ptProfile?resource_id=11748) and [Dr. Kevin Kircher](https://kevinjkircher.com/).

Broadly speaking I am interested in Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) and how to smartly connect them for advanced grid capabilities. 

This website will host my academic portfolio, but that doesn't mean there won't be fun stuff on here too, so feel free to check it out!

Best way to contact me is through [email](afarha@purdue.edu)
