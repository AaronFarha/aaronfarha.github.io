What is the point of blogging? I am not sure! This is mostly going to be experimental from my end so I can continue exercising my writing skills. This might become a collection of random thoughts and ideas that are important to me. It might just become movie and book recommendation lists. It doesn't quite matter to me what I write about, the act of containing my ideas in bite-sized chunks that are coherent is what I'm interested in.

Another aspect that draws me to this as a hobby is the publicity. That helps push me to think about the writing I want to publish before it goes into the collective subconscious of the internet. It's almost like a distilling process for ideas: I can think of ideas in my own time, mull them over, and process them for the blog. Cool! 

Maybe in the future, I can start a new section of my website to include engineering notes as a resource to double back on.
