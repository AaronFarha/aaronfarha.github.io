I am not sure! This is mostly going to be experimental from my end so I can continue exercising my writing skills. This might become a collection of random thoughts and ideas that are important to me. It might just become movie and book recommendation lists. It doesn’t quite matter to me what I write about, the act of containing my ideas in bite-sized chunks that are coherent is what I’m interested in.</p> <p>Another aspect that draws me to this as a hobby is the publicity. That helps push me to think about the writing I want to publish before it goes into the collective subconscious of the internet. It’s almost like a distilling process for ideas: I can think of ideas in my own time, mull them over, and process them for the blog. Cool!</p> <p>Maybe in the future, I can start a new section of my website to include engineering notes as a resource to double back on.</p> <p><strong>&lt;hr&gt;</strong></p> <blockquote> Everything was beautiful, and nothing hurt. —Kurt Vonnegut </blockquote>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="starting"/><category term="out"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[testing out blogging on the website and thinking about its purpose]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</title><link href="https://aaronfarha.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog"/><published>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</updated><id>https://aaronfarha.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://aaronfarha.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry></feed>
